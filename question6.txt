6. How to delete one commit or multiple commits permanently Write command for it
Ans-
For deleting a multiple commits permanently:

2- Run the command '$ git reset --hard HEAD~i' where i is the index of the commit from the HEAD to which we need to delete all the 'i' latest commits.


For deleting a single commit:
